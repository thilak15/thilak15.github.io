      <h3>Communication Technology</h3>Communication technologies include the Internet, multimedia, e-mail, telephone
      and other sound-based and video-based communication
      Communication technology specialists design and maintain technical systems of communication, according to the
      needs of a specific business, industry or market.
      which refers to all communication technologies, including the internet, wireless networks, cell phones, computers,
      software, middleware, video-conferencing, social networking,
      and other media applications and services enabling users to access, retrieve, store, transmit, and manipulate
      information in a digital form.
      it is used to refer to the convergence of media technology such as audio-visual and telephone networks with
      computer networks, by means of a unified system of cabling (including signal distribution and management) or link
      system.
      However, there is no universally accepted definition of communication technology considering that the concepts,
      methods and tools involved in communication technology are steadily evolving on an almost daily basis.</p>

      <h3>Medical Technology</h3>Medical technology has saved countless lives.Rapid advances in biomedical research have
      indeed stimulated the development of numerous efficacious medical technologies.Technological innovation in
      medicine covers the wide range of events by which a new medical technology is discovered or invented, developed,
      and disseminated into health care. Technological innovation in medicine covers the wide range of events by which a
      new medical technology is discovered or invented, developed, and disseminated into health care.
      Studies show that recent equipment has evolved more in the last ten to twenty years than in the past thousand
      years. Medical technology is a broad field where innovation plays a crucial role in sustaining health. Areas like
      biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, information technology, the development of medical devices and equipment, and more
      have all made significant contributions to improving the health of people all around the world. From “small”
      innovations like adhesive bandages and ankle braces, to larger, more complex technologies like MRI machines,
      artificial organs, and robotic prosthetic limbs, technology has undoubtedly made an incredible impact on medicine.

      <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>Artificial intelligence (AI), is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the
      natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals.
      It refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic
      their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such
      as learning and problem-solving.</p>

      <h3>Space Technology</h3>Space technology is technology developed by space science or the aerospace industry for
      use in spaceflight, satellites, or space exploration. Space technology includes spacecraft, satellites, space
      stations, and support infrastructure, equipment, and procedures and space warfare. Space is such a novel
      environment that attempting to work in it requires new tools and techniques. Many common everyday services such as
      weather forecasting, remote sensing, GPS systems, satellite television, and some long-distance communications
      systems critically rely on space infrastructure. Of the sciences, astronomy and Earth science benefit from space
      technology
      space applications include meteorology; navigation, position location, and timing; and military and national
      security uses.

      <h3>Large Company Entrepreneurship</h3>There are finite life cycles found in large companies as the majority of
      them grow using innovation. It let them create new variants apart from core products they manufacture. The reasons
      for disruptive innovations are customization in the demand of customer, establishment of new technologies and the
      emergence of new competitors among others.
      It results in the creation of completely new products so that these challenges can tackle successfully. The large
      companies do this either by creating disruptive products or by acquiring innovative organizations. The disruptive
      innovation becomes pretty difficult to apply in large organizations.</p>
